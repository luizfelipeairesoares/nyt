# nyt

NYT is an small project that fetches articles from the [Most Popular API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/most-popular-product/1/overview) of the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/).

The minimum `iOS` version supported is **13.0**.

## Architecture

Since it's a small project, I decided to use the MVC approach, but not the way we see around there.

 - The `View` classes (for example the `ListView`) has all the UI components.
 - The `ViewController` classes manages the data that is shown in the view and communicates with the `Services` classes. `ViewControllers` also conforms to `Protocols` created for them. The idea is to inject the dependencies that the class will need. Also it helps when developing the unit tests.
 - I used the ViewCode approach, so there aren't storyboard files. Except for the `LaunchScreen.storyboard`.
 - There's also a simple `Coordinator` that creates the `TabBarController` component.
 - I created an `Environment` class that gets the API Server and API Key from the project's file, that are under `Build Settings > User-Defined`. This approach is helpful when there's Staging and Production environments and we can easily change the environment just changing the scheme.
 - `Code coverage` is at **86%** the last time I tested.

## Running the project

I like to use Gemfiles to manage [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) dependencies ([CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) and [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/)).

If you have [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed, follow these steps:
 1. In the project's folder, run `bundle install`.
 2. Then, run `bundle exec pod install`.
 3. Done! ðŸŽ‰

If Bundler isn't installed, just run `pod install` in the project's folder to install CocoadPods's dependencies.

Then, open `nyt-foil.xcworkspace` file.

## Other informations

I could not find any API to show the article detail. That's why the `DetailView` has only a `WKWebView` to load the article URL.

In the `ListView` I added a simple `SegmentedControl` where the user can select the period (1 day, 7 days or 30 days).

Reviewing this project I noticed that I could've used git flow but I didn't thought about it when I started it, probably because it was a small project and it was just me pushing the changes.
